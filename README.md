This project uses deep learning to classify brain MRI images into four categories: Glioma, Meningioma, Pituitary Tumor, and No Tumor. It includes both a custom CNN and a MobileNetV2 transfer learning model, and is deployed via a Streamlit app for real-time predictions.
* Sourced from Kaggle

* 4 classes of MRI images

* Preprocessed with resizing, normalization, and augmentation
  
* MobileNetV2 Accuracy: ~91%

* Confusion matrix shows good performance on all classes

* Real-time prediction via web app
